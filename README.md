I completed a personal project on data mining and machine learning model 1 using R coding at the National College of Ireland

## About 

This project, which marked my initial foray into R coding, focused on data mining and machine learning model 1. 
It followed the KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) process, encompassing stages such as Selection, Preprocessing, Transformation, Data Mining, and Interpretation/Evaluation.

## Datasets

I utilized three datasets from Kaggle for this project, each serving a specific purpose. The datasets are as follows:

1. Beer Data Analystics (beer_1)

2. Melbourne Housing Market (melb)
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market?select=Melbourne_housing_FULL.csv

3. Russia Real Estate 2018-2021 (estate)
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrdaniilak/russia-real-estate-20182021

## Questions
1. Which factor is the most influences the beer review score?

2. Is the house price predictable in the Melbourne house
market?

3. the Housing type can classifier in the Melbourne house
market?

4. How to distinguish the target house price is high or low in
the Russia real estate market?

## Models selection

- Linear regression - beer_1
- Linear regression - melb
- Ridge regression - melb
- K-Nearest Neighbors models - melb
