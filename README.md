The data mining and machine learning model 1 personal project in National college of Ireland (R coding)

## About this project which I have learned from my first R coding and the data analytics process follows KDD which is Knowledge Discovery in Databases.

Selection -> Preprocessing -> Transformation -> Data Mining -> Interpretation / Evaluation

##Datasets

There are three datasets I used from Kaggle and the link below:

1. Beer Data Analystics (beer_1)

2. Melbourne Housing Market (melb)

market?

3. the Housing type can classifier in the Melbourne house
market?

4. How to distinguish the target house price is high or low in
the Russia real estate market?
